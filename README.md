# Portfolio Website : Google search-themed portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio project, which is basically a google-themed search results page. With over 86% of the search market share, one hardly needs to introduction Google. We are the most familiar with this incredible search engine, so I thought, "Why not present my portfolio in the format that everyone likes the most, in a format which everyone recognizes?" Well, no reason not to! So, here's the end result of bringing that vision into a codebase. 

It's not just a collection of projects; it's a canvas that reflects my journey, showcasing my ability to create elegant and user-friendly web experiences. Please, indulge yourselves.
